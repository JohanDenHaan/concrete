_Concrete_ is a generic model editor which can be configured for different
domain specific languages (DSLs). When you use it, you use it for a predefined DSL.
The DSL describes what the model may look like, both from a content and a visual point of view.
See the Developers Guide if you want to setup your own DSL.

This document describes the usage of the editor, independant of any specific DSL.


== Models ==

Models consist of +elements+ which may have attributes, references to other elements and may contain other elements. 

+Attributes+ can take one or more primitive values. Currently
primitive values are of type +String+, +Integer+, +Boolean+, or custom defined +Enum+ datatypes. +Enum+ types have
a name and consist of a set of string literals, each of which is a valid instance of the type.

+References+ point to one or more other elements. References can not point to or take primitive values.

+Containment+ relationships are references with the difference that the contained element is part of the parent element,
whereas the referenced element normally is not (there may be exceptions). When the parent element is deleted, the contained
elements are also deleted. When the parent element is collapsed the contained elements are hidden.
 
Attributes, reference and containmend relationships are called _features_ of an element. Features have names, 
although they may not be visible.

Attributes and references contain _values_ whereas containment relationships contain _elements_.


== Navigation and Selection ==

=== Selecting Elements/Values ===

For all editing commands described below, at least one element or attribute/reference value needs to be selected. 
Selection can be done with the arrow keys (+Left+, +Right+, +Up+, +Down+), with +Tab+ and +Shift-Tab+ or with the mouse.

Selection with the mouse is straightforward, just click the element.

Using the key +Tab+ and +Shift-Tab+, the next/previous element/value can be selected with respect to the logical order
(instead of the graphical order on the screen). If an element has other elements or values inside, +Tab+ will select 
the first child, and so on.

In contrast to the tab keys, the arrow keys select with respect to the graphical position on the screen.
Press one of +Left+, +Right+, +Up+, +Down+, to move the selection in the respective direction.
When an element has other elements or values inside, the next selected element may be one of these elements.
In order to know if the next selected element is inside or outside of the current element, you need to be aware of 
the current _cursor_ position. The _cursor_ is a little dot on the border of the selected element/value.
If the cursor is on the left border and you press +Right+, the next selected element will be inside of the
current element (given that it has child elements). Otherwise, if you press +Left+, the next selected element
will be outside, left of the current element (given that there are elements on the left). The same is true for the
other directions, of course. If the next element would be outside but there are no elements in this direction, the 
parent element will be selected.

Hold +Shift+ down shift while moving the selection with any of the methods described above to extend to selection (_multi select_).

=== Navigating References ===

When you move the mouse over a valid reference value while prssing +Ctrl+, the reference target will be highlighted.
However, you might not see the target if it is outside of the visible area on the screen.

You can click the left mouse button on a valid reference value while pressing +Ctrl+ to select the reference target.
This will automatically scroll to make the target visible.

References can also be followed by pressing +Alt-Right+ while a valid reference value is selected. This will select
the target element and scroll to make it visible. By pressing +Alt-Left+ you can go back the references in reverse order.

=== Folding ===

Elements with containment relationships can be collapsed using +Ctrl-Left+. This will hide the containment relationships
including the contained elements. In order to expand the element again, press +Ctrl-Right+.

You can collapse and expand elements recursively using +Ctrl-Shift-Left+ and +Ctrl-Shift-Right+. This will also
collapse/expand child elements.

In addition to this, empty features may collapse depending on the DSL configuration. This happens when you leave
the currently selected element (i.e. select another element which is not a child). You can show all hidden featurs
be pressing +Shift-Return+. This command also expands the current element.

All collapsing commands also work with multiple elements selected.

Depending on the DSL, folding may also be triggered by clicking on the fold button (e.g. a plus or minus sign).


== Editing ==

=== Edit Mode ===

Whenever you want to actually edit text (e.g. to edit an attribute value or choose an element's type) you need to be in _edit mode_.
The easiest way to enter edit mode is by just typing text while an element/value is selected. More explicitly you may also
click the element or value while it is already selected or press +F2+ or +Ctrl-Space+.

You can leave edit mode and cancel your edit by pressing +Esc+ or click the mouse somewhere outside of the current edit box.

In order to leaave edit mode and actually use your changes, press +Return+, +Tab+ or +Shift-Tab+.
If an error is detected with your input (e.g. because you entered letters for an Integer value), 
you can not successfully leave edit mode. In this case, either correct your input or cancel edit mode.

If a set of completion options is available for the current element/value, a dropdown box will be shown in edit mode
when you start typing. You can bring up the dropdown box without typing by pressing one of the arrow keys.


=== Creating Elements ===

Elements can be created on toplevel or as children in a containment relationship. If in either place, there are no 
other elements yet, an empty placeholder element will be shown.
In this case, select the placeholder, enter edit mode and type the name of the element class to be created.
Once in edit mode, a dropdown box appears showing possible completion options.

If an element should be added to a set of existing elements, select one of the existing ones and press +Return+.
This will insert a placeholder after the selected element and immediately enter edit mode.

When an element is created, all features are shown although they are empty. Depending on the configuration of the
editor, empty features may be hidden when you select a different element which is not a child. In oder to 
show the hidden features again, press +Shift-Return+.

=== Changing the Element Type ===

When you enter edit mode while an element is selected, the element's type can be changed. When the type changes,
feature values will be preserved for features which also exist in the new type.

=== Deleting Elements ===

Elements can be deleted by pressing +Del+. This also works if multiple elements are selected.

=== Editing Attribute Values ===

In a newly created element, no attribute values exist. You can create an attribute value by entering edit mode on 
an empty value placeholder. As with elements, pressing +Return+ on a value will insert another value, pressing +Del+ removes the value.
In case the attribute to be edited is hidden, press +Shift-Return+ to show it.

=== Editing Reference Values ===

Reference values can be edited in the same way as attribute values. The content of a reference value is the identifier
of the referenced element. Use the dropdown box in edit mode to choose one of the possible target elements.
Note, that only elements with an identifier can be referenced.

=== Copy and Paste ===

Both element and values can be cut, copied and pasted with +Ctrl-X+, +Ctrl-C+ and +Ctrl-V+ respectively. This also works
with multiples elements selected. Note however, that you can not paste an attribute or reference value where an element
is expected and vice versa.


== Errors ==

The DSL defines constraints on possible models. For example, for some attributes only a single value might be
allowed, whereas for other attributes you may provide more than one value. 
If a constraint is violated for an element or feature, the element/feature will be marked as erroneous.
Move the mouse over such an element in order to show the error message in a popup window.
